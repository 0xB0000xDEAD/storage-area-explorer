# Storage Area Explorer 0.1


This is a simple extension which allows to inspect [Storage Area](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/storage.html) of [Chrome Packaged Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html)

Storage Area tab is added to the devtools, so you'll need to inspect app in order to reveal this tab.




~~This extension is not yet deployed to the Chrome Web Store since I don't have a nice icon yet (and most likely Chrome team will add such feature sooner or later).~~

~~So to use it you need to checkout and manually install this extension.~~

Install from [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/storage-area-explorer/ocfjjjjhkpapocigimmppepjgfdecjkb)
